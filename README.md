# star-catalogue
A catalogue of the stars using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS for CSC 455
Hosted here http://satoshi.cis.uncw.edu/~cns5289/starPage.php

Note: Requires access to the UNCW network physically or through VPN.
Only stars of a few particular constellations are in the database.
This is a proof of concept rather than a full service.
